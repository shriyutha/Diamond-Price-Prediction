## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# lets begin......

# A Diamond is a precious stone formed from an colorless crystalline form of pure carbon. As we all know, a diamond has been an all time preference in the section of ornaments. So diamonds are widely used in making different kinds of jewelries and decorative items.

# when compare to other ornaments, the price of the diamond is bit high. So it is very important to have knowledge about diamond features and price distributions, and mainly understanding diamonds are very important, because each diamond is unique in its way.

# That is the main reason I have chosen this data set.

# Here in this data set, I am predicting the price of the diamonds with all remaining variables are given.

# Carat, cut and clarity are the primary factor responsible for variation of price.
